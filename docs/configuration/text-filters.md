# Text Filters ðŸš§

As well as supporting configuraiton of filtering through a popup menu, there is the ability to filter items by a simple text input. The following outlines the available syntax for different filtering options.

## Overview

The following rules are used across all text search types:

- _String Splitting :_ A single text filtering string is split into multiple filters split by a space (i.e. `searchA account:searchB` would search for `searchA` and `account:searchB`). If there is the desire to filter an item that has a space in it, then quotes can be used (i.e. `search A" account:"search B` would search for `search A` and `account:"search B"`).
- _Prefixes :_ For each type of filtering ther are different _prefixes_ wchih can be used (outlined below). For example `account:search` would search the account name for `search`.
- _Exclude :_ Putting a `!` in front of a search inverts the search. So `!account:search` would search for account names that _don't_ include `search`
- _Default Action :_ For any search item that doesn't have a prefix, there will be a default action applied. There is also a defaut action for search items that don't have an existing prefix, and start with a `!`.
- _Multiple Of Same Prefix :_ When there are multiple of the same prefix or action, then the way this is handled depends on the prefix / action.
- _Boolean Prefix :_ Some filters are a boolean (yes / no) filter. For these items the filter prefix and exclude filter prefix are used (i.e. `cash:` and `!cash:`), rather than writing true or false (i.e. `cash:true` and `cash:false`). Any text written after the colon is ignored (i.e. `cash:false` and `cash:cash` is the same as `cash:`)
