TODO : Make column visibility controlled by a dropdown and matching wrapper component (possibly just make a cell and header wrapper?). Use a local storage store for this rather than the URL.
TODO : Improve filtering for journals (dropdown?)
TODO : Add statistics / summary / graphcs to journal page
TODO : Importing - Setup importing
TODO : Importing - Setup database structure (and env variables) to support importing. This will require "importId" and "importData" columns for journals, and an import table.
TODO : Make "/" page work correctly.
TODO : Make Clone and Edit Journals pages so that they don't waste as much space.
TODO : Make "tags" in journal list be a link to the page for something. Possibly have a dropdown that allows for selection of editing that item, bulk editing related journals, or show related journals.
TODO : Labels - Make these show on journal page
TODO : Labels - Confirm filters for these work correctly.
TODO : Labels - Make add / remove labels when editing or cloning journals work.
TODO : More columns in linked item views, including journal count.
TODO : Lables - Confirm that cloning a journal also clones labels.
TODO : Favicon + Page Titles
TODO : Add "Create Transaction" page (currently links to creating a new tag)
OPTION : Consider whether direct editing from a table view is beneficial for journals, or if the current approach is OK. Maybe have a special edit journals mode or something? Could have that clicking an item opens a dropdown to edit it.
OPTION : Consider pre-loading page data.
OPTION : Consider adding "otherAccountId" / "payee" to the bulk update form.
OPTION : Consider colour coding tags / bills / budgets / categories / tags etc...
OPTION : Consider refactoring out the journals table if this is useful elsehwere - currently this isn't required.
OPTION : Improve mobile functionality.
OPTION : Add Spark Graph to link information views to show relevant information.
